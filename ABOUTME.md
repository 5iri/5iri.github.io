<h2>heyoo</h2>

I am shri.

I love working on silicon, hardware, and seeing my vision come up everything from scratch.

I'm 19, I love drinking redbull and eating chips.

what do I say, I love being a 100x engineer. (yes that's supposed to be a flex).

If I am really bored, I just change the looks of my website or update documentation. (yes that's my really bored but I wanna do something work)


I am a music enthusiast, love really expensive headphones (please buy me one <3)

<h2> levels to beat yet </h2>

 - Neuromorphic Hardware
 - Currently working my ass on snns
 - OPENCPU enthusiast
 - in a vow to make silicon cheaper
 - I built a cpu in 2 months, now spending my time working on cooler shit or upgrading that old cpu. (hopefully before I complete my engineering I make it a OOO cpu)
