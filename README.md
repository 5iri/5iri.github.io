# About me

 - Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shri, a passionate and curious sophomore Electrical Engineering student in India. My journey often involves designing novel solutions in VLSI, robotics, and embedded systems. I am very good at the module where hardware meets software; 
 - I usually explore how they work together to bring ideas to life.  
## What I Do

### Digital Design Enthusiast
 
 - Implemented a fully functional RISC-V CPU on FPGA from scratch, specializing in low-level digital design and computer architecture.

 - Right now, I am working on verifying the same CPU formally.
### Embedded Systems Developer
 - Building RTOS solutions for ESP32, focusing on advanced features like task scheduling, context switching, and interrupt service routines.

### Robotics Innovator
 - Developing resilient robotic systems including a 3-DOF manipulator and lunar rover, with expertise in Gazebo simulation and real-world applications.

 - Developing a Bio-inspired turtle-like robot for observing their habitat and ecosystem.

### Sustainability Advocate
 - Actively contributing to environmental initiatives, including beach cleanup projects, committed to creating lasting positive impact.

## My Vision

 - I am determined to create the boldest solutions bridging the gap between breakthrough technologies and real-world challenges, ensuring a much further advancement in VLSI design, and optimising robotics control systems for energy-efficient devices. I see this as an attempt to constantly push one's limits and that learning goes hand in hand; you get that way. 

## Some Fun Facts About Me 
 - I have a profound love for physics, where I delve into in-depth knowledge about JFETs to understand how the thing runs all the modern devices.

 - I'm passionate about mentoring and teaching. I think part of my work includes imparting robotics and automation skills to freshmen at the university. 

 - I thrive on creativity in my designs. My design is my creativity... I feel great about brainstorming on some crazy ideal ideas.
