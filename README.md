# Hey There!
I'm Shri Vishakh Devanand, a second-year engineering student from India with a serious passion for math, physics, and electronics. Iâ€™m all about blending hardware and software, using math to tackle real-world engineering problems.

## What Iâ€™m Up To

- Built my own RISC-V CPU on an FPGA from the ground up
- Geek out over complex analysis, abstract algebra, and discrete math
- Working on a custom Zig-based compiler for ESP32
- Crafting bio-inspired robots that act like real animals

## My Big Picture
Math is my playgroundâ€”itâ€™s how I optimize code, design circuits, and build control systems. I love exploring that sweet spot where pure theory meets hands-on engineering.

## A Bit About Me

 - I keep a notebook full of cool math proofs (still gotta organize them into one epic collection ðŸ˜…)
 - Puzzles? I can get lost in those for hours
 - Always chasing a new challenge to keep things exciting

Swing by my GitHub or LinkedIn to check out my projects or just say hiâ€”Iâ€™m always down to chat about math, tech, or anything youâ€™re fired up about. Oh, and donâ€™t miss my blogs in the nav bar! ðŸ˜„
