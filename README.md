![Hi!](markdown_files/posts/assets/me.jpeg) ![Me teaching error correction for First Year Students](markdown_files/posts/assets/me2.png)
# Yo!
 I'm **Shri Vishakh Devanand**, a sophomore engineering student from India absolutely obsessed with mathematics, physics and electronics. I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, applying complex mathematical concepts to solve real engineering challenges.

## What I Do
- Built a fully functional RISC-V CPU on FPGA from scratch
- Dive deep into complex analysis, abstract algebra, and discrete mathematics
- Developing custom zig based compiler for ESP32.
- Create bio-inspired robots that mimic animal behavior.

## My Vision
Mathematics is my universal language for innovation - whether optimizing algorithms, designing circuits, or modeling control systems. I'm constantly exploring the beautiful intersection where theoretical math meets practical engineering.

## Fun Facts
- Maintain a personal notebook of elegant mathematical proofs (collecting all of them into a single one is remaining ðŸ˜…)
- Can lose myself for hours in puzzles
- Love to challenge myself
