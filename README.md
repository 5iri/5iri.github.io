# ABOUT
{: .fs-9 .fw-900 }

<div class="te-card">
  <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
  <p>Math is my playground‚Äîit's how I optimize code, design circuits, and build control systems. I love exploring that sweet spot where pure theory meets hands-on engineering. Mathematics isn't just a tool; it's the language that bridges the gap between abstract concepts and real-world solutions.</p>
</div>

## BACKGROUND

Hey there! I'm Shri Vishakh Devanand, a second-year engineering student from India with a serious passion for math, physics, and electronics. I'm all about blending hardware and software, using math to tackle real-world engineering problems.

### CURRENT PURSUITS

- **Hardware Engineering**: Building systems from the ground up
- **Mathematical Applications**: Applying pure theory to practical problems  
- **Bio-inspired Design**: Creating systems that mimic natural behaviors
- **Compiler Development**: Bridging high-level languages with embedded systems

## INSPIRATION

My work is driven by the intersection of:

- **Pure Mathematics**: The elegance of mathematical proofs and abstract thinking
- **Applied Engineering**: Solving real-world problems with technical solutions
- **Bio-inspired Design**: Learning from nature's optimized systems
- **Open Source Philosophy**: Sharing knowledge and building together

## A BIT ABOUT ME

<div class="te-grid">
  <div class="te-card-minimal">
    <h4>PERSONAL QUIRKS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I keep a notebook full of cool math proofs (still gotta organize them into one epic collection üòÖ)</li>
      <li>Puzzles? I can get lost in those for hours</li>
      <li>Always chasing a new challenge to keep things exciting</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="te-card-minimal">
    <h4>APPROACH</h4>
    <p>I believe in learning by building. Whether it's a CPU, a compiler, or a robot, I dive deep into both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Every project is an opportunity to push boundaries and explore new possibilities.</p>
