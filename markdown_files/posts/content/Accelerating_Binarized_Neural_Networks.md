# Accelerating Binarized Neural Networks: Comparison of FPGA, CPU, GPU, and ASIC

---
## Abstract
  - DNNs are widely used in data analytics. A form of DNN called BNN (Binarized Neural Networks) were proposed as optimized variant of DNNs.
  - Compared BNNs run on optimized hardware design (on ARIA 10 FPGA) as well as 14-nm ASIC, and Intel Xeon server CPUs, NVIDIA Titan X GPU and TX1 mobile GPUs.
