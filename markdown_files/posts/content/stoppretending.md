# The Smartest People I know Love asking Questions

ukw, most people are human. <br>
people forget that.


Here's the fact: the smartest people I've met, the ones who give me no BS conversations, are the ones who constantly ask questions.

A couple of my friends, whom I always want to keep by my side, are [Prajwal](https://crisiumnih.github.io) and [Atharva](https://ksagar.site); I consider to be the smartest.

These people, from what I observe, always ask questions.

The point that people forget is the ability to be curious. <br>
smart people tend to be the ones to **understand it better**, tear it apart, and build it again from scratch. 

And honestly, that changed everything for me.

That was the first time in my life that I had observed someone with similar interests to be like me, but better. They were the ones who _built_ things, and didn't just do things to **pass some exam**, **finish some course**, or **get a degree**.

# Ask out loud.

In a call. <br>
In a classroom. <br>
In a discussion. <br>
In your head, while reading a research paper, a book, or even just sitting around. <br>
Ask what you think is “too basic.” <br>
Ask the same question twice, phrased differently. <br>
Ask so you can build from _first principles_ — not just skim through someone else’s explanation. 


And if someone mocks you for asking, that’s a great way to tell them they don’t know much themselves.
