<h2 id="what-are-cancer-cells">What are cancer cells?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>fuck ups in DNA causes genes to mutate, which makes a particular types of cells to not listen to the conditions for which the genes to mutate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-cancer-grow">How does Cancer grow?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A cancer cell is different from normal ceels because they:
    <ul>
      <li>divide out of control</li>
      <li>are immature and don’t develop into doing their jobs</li>
      <li>avoid the immune system.</li>
      <li>ignore signals</li>
      <li>don’t stick to each other very well and can spread to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system</li>
      <li>grow into and damage tissues and organs
        <h2 id="how-cancer-spreads">How cancer spreads?</h2>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Normal spread usually by pushing on normal tissues and growing into a big ball in the same place, this is called local invasion or invasive cancer.</li>
  <li>Cancer can also spread from where it first started to other parts of the body.  This process is called metastatis. Cancer cells can metastatsize when they break away from the tumour and travel to a new location in the body through the blood or lymphatic system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-does-cancer-come-back-sometimes">Why does cancer come back sometimes?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>even if 1 cancer cell is left begind during cancer treatment, it has the possibility of growing and dividing into a new tumour.</li>
  <li>In some cases, treatment may stop working (become resistant) so cancer cells are no longer being destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-use-acoustic-tweezers">Why use acoustic tweezers?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It produces high and low acoustic pressures, enabling the movement or positioning of target cells with precision. This allows them to be used for manipulating metastasis-related cancer cells.</li>
  <li>The flow cytometry results prove that it is non-invasive.</li>
  <li>It can be used to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and enables in developing targeted treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-make-acoustic-tweezers">how to make acoustic tweezers?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The new device works by placing sound-creating transducers on each side of a small square chamber filled with liquid. These four transducers work in step with those directly across from them, forming two pairs. One creates patterns in the chamber horizontally and the other vertically. The interaction of these two complex, quickly changing sound wave patterns creates dynamic abilities never before demonstrated within the field.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-acoustic-streaming">what is acoustic streaming?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Acoustic streaming is another important principle that underlies acoustic tweezers. When a sound wave passes through a fluid medium, it creates tiny vortexes of fluid around the edges of the wave. These vortexes can be used to move small objects within the fluid, even against the direction of the sound wave itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-cases-other-than-biomedicine">Use cases other than biomedicine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In microelectronics, acoustic tweezers have the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing process for microchips and other tiny electronic components. By using sound waves to position and manipulate these components, researchers can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the manufacturing process.</li>
