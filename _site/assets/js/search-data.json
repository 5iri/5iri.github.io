The instruction received by the decoder to decode the instruction into what generally occurs into 3 or 4 different things. The instruction type is defined by the operation code. | The source values are given as the address of its place in the register, rather than the value itself, or for some instructions there comes something called immediate values, where you don’t want to store the value but just use the value for another calculation and lose it. | Then the destination register, where the calculated value is going to be stored until it is stored in memory or discarded. | Then, it goes into the control unit, where it decides what type of calculation is required for this particular instruction and sends it to the ALU to calculate it. | . | Once the final result is received by the control unit, it is then stored in the destination register as instructed. | .

Here’s a detailed breakdown of our progress: . | Code Optimization: We revisited the M extension to refine the code, focusing on enhancing efficiency and ensuring proper functionality. | Simulation: Using Vivado, we simulated the RV32-IM extensions. The simulation verified that the new instructions for multiplication and division were correctly implemented and functioning as expected. | Debugging and Validation: During simulation, we meticulously debugged the code to identify and fix any issues. This process was crucial for validating the correctness of our implementation. | Documentation: Alongside coding and simulation, we documented our process and findings.

    "title": "Notes on how are cancer cells grow and spread through the body",
    "content": "# Notes on how are cancer cells grow and spread through the body --- ## What are cancer cells? - fuck ups in DNA causes genes to mutate, which makes a particular types of cells to not listen to the conditions for which the genes to mutate. ## How does Cancer grow? - A cancer cell is different from normal ceels because they: - divide out of control - are immature and don't develop into doing their jobs - avoid the immune system. - ignore signals - don't stick to each other very well and can spread to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system - grow into and damage tissues and organs ## How cancer spreads? - Normal spread usually by pushing on normal tissues and growing into a big ball in the same place, this is called local invasion or invasive cancer. - Cancer can also spread from where it first started to other parts of the body. This process is called metastatis. Cancer cells can metastatsize when they break away from the tumour and travel to a new location in the body through the blood or lymphatic system. ## Why does cancer come back sometimes? - even if 1 cancer cell is left begind during cancer treatment, it has the possibility of growing and dividing into a new tumour. - In some cases, treatment may stop working (become resistant) so cancer cells are no longer being destroyed. ## Why use acoustic tweezers? - It produces high and low acoustic pressures, enabling the movement or positioning of target cells with precision. This allows them to be used for manipulating metastasis-related cancer cells. - The flow cytometry results prove that it is non-invasive. - It can be used to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and enables in developing targeted treatments. ## how to make acoustic tweezers? - The new device works by placing sound-creating transducers on each side of a small square chamber filled with liquid. These four transducers work in step with those directly across from them, forming two pairs. One creates patterns in the chamber horizontally and the other vertically. The interaction of these two complex, quickly changing sound wave patterns creates dynamic abilities never before demonstrated within the field. ## what is acoustic streaming? - Acoustic streaming is another important principle that underlies acoustic tweezers. When a sound wave passes through a fluid medium, it creates tiny vortexes of fluid around the edges of the wave. These vortexes can be used to move small objects within the fluid, even against the direction of the sound wave itself. ## Use cases other than biomedicine - In microelectronics, acoustic tweezers have the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing process for microchips and other tiny electronic components. By using sound waves to position and manipulate these components, researchers can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the manufacturing process. - ## resources - [How cancer starts, grows and spreads](https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/what-is-cancer/how-cancer-starts-grows-and-spreads) - [acoustic tweezers](https://acoustofluidics.pratt.duke.edu/research/acoustic-tweezers) - [Cells Dancing to Harmonic Duets Could Enable Personalized Cancer Therapies](https://pratt.duke.edu/news/harmonic-acoustic-tweezers/) ",

    "content": "# Requirements, Bottlenecks, and Good Fortune: Agents for Microprocessor Evolution ``` by yale patt ``` ## Basic Framework - Computer Architecture: A science of tradeoffs - Comp arch is more \"art\" than \"science\" - Almost always the job of the comp architect requires using that fundamental knowledge to make tradeoffs. - Levels of Transformation - There are levels of transformations that is being done whenever there's a high level program that is being done. - Like take for example a C code, it first compiles into an assembly code (a lot more process that happens but not imp here). - This \"assembly\" code is basically converted into where ISA structure is used, where ISA defines on how the assembly code is being defined. - Now, Even though the \"assembly\" code is now converted into something in binary, how this binary is being processed is (which bits need to go where in order for the \"assembly\" line to be processed actually) [Instruction is being processed] - This is called microarchitecture. - This microarchitecture is defined by actual electronic circuit design, and in the end electrons. - These are the levels of transformation that occurs from any problem to actually making it solve by a circuit (or by electrons). ![Levels of Transformation](/markdown_files/posts/assets/comparchreads/image1.png) - Design Points - When working in the microarchitecture part, there is always a purpose towards what you are trying to achieve. - This is called the Design Point. - It could be something like, making a core more power efficient , fault tolerant (server chips), highest power etc. - Application Space - Sometimes the chips that we design are application specific, and sometimes generalistic in nature, this is what we call application space here. - The Basics of Processing - Simply put, a microprocessor processes instructions. - To do this, it has to do three things: - Supply instructions to the core of the processor where the instructions are executed. - Supply data required for the instructions - Perform the operation required by each instruction. - Instruction Supply - fetching one instruction at a time is slow when processors are getting faster and better at processing them. - So, the fetching of instructions should be done in parallel, making it more efficient. - Data Supply - Once the instruction is fetched, the data required for the instruction is supplied to the processor. - This must be done in a fast manner as well. - So faster caches (on-chip RAM) are used to supply the data for a particular instruction. - Instruction Processing - Once the instruction is fetched and the data is supplied, the instruction must also be processed fast. - To perform the operations required by these instructions, the processor needs a sufficient number of functional units to process the data. ## Agents for Evolution - The creativity of engineers to come up with answers where there were problems--- without solutions, there would be no Evolution. - Agent I: New Requirements - The demand for higher performance dictated that fetching one instruction at a time was not enough. - Examples like this forces evolution and creative solution thinking. - Agent II: Bottlenecks - We have 3 components of instruction processing (instruction supply, data supply, and carrying out the operations of the instruction). - By far, most of the improvements to the microprocessor have come about due to attempts to eliminate bottlenecks that prevent these components from being fully utilized. - Agent III: Good Fortune - Good Fortune happens when something causes a windfall which can then be used to provide additional features to the microprocessor.
